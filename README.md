# CBC Simulator

Under Construction!!

### Getting started

CBC Simulator depends on [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) which is Graph Visualization Software.

You can install Graphviz via Homebrew in macOS.

```
brew install graphviz
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The result of simulation will be generated in `output` directory by default.
